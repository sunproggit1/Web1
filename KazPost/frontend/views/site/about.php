<h3 class="alert alert-warning">History of Kazakhstan Post</h3>
<p class="alert alert-danger">
Mail arose as a tool for transmitting information and managing the state and only later became available to the general public. In 1860, the first post office of communication was opened in Verny (Almaty), which was soon transformed into a post and telegraph office, which in 1883 already controlled 14 post offices of communication.
<br><br>
In the USSR from 1924 to 1991, the postal service of the Kazakh SSR was an integral part of the unified Soviet communications system and postage fees were paid in stamps of the Soviet Union on the territory of the republic.
<br><br>
The Great Patriotic War posed a difficult and responsible task for the post - in all conditions, to provide regular reliable communications in the army, in the rear, between the front and rear. Particular difficulties at the beginning of the war also arose because a large number of skilled signalmen were drafted into the army.
<br><br>
In March 1946, the Commissioner of the People’s Commissariat of Communications of the USSR under the SNK of the Kazakh SSR was renamed the Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications of the USSR under the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR. In 1950, there were already 2438 postal enterprises in the republic (2083 in rural areas). On December 25, 1954, the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the USSR Ministry of Communications was transformed into the Ministry of Communications of the Kazakh SSR, and the postal and electric communications formed a single branch, Svyaz, within this ministry. Since the mid-60s, more than 4,000 post offices with a full range of postal services functioned in Kazakhstan. During this period, the postal service of the republic worked cost-effectively, but the industry’s profit was mainly directed to the development of telecommunications. Most of the income was provided through the delivery of pensions and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. A sharp change in the situation in the industry occurred after Kazakhstan gained independence and sovereignty. Under these conditions, Kazakhstani post (as well as all branches of the national economy) faced certain difficulties and problems associated with price liberalization during the period of fundamental changes in the country's economy and a violation of the harmonious postal system of the former Soviet Union.
</p><p class="alert alert-success">
Kazakhstan gained independence in December 1991 and immediately set about organizing its own mail. The period of 1999-2000, when the transition to corporatization took place, was difficult for Kazakhstan, since all the activities of the postal industry underwent transformation. The transition from the state form of management to corporatization transferred the industry to self-financing, developing an independent foreign borrowing policy to modernize the material and technical base, developing strategic directions of development aimed at strengthening the company's market position, including expanded diversification of activities and the conquest of new niches.

Currently, Kazpost JSC is the sole shareholder (100% share) of the company Kazpost LLC (Germany).</p>
